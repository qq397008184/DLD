This module contains base classes for active learning protocols.

These are protocols intended to be abstract, and importing these
classes specifically is intended to either be subclassed, or for
type annotations.

Protocol Architecture
---------------------
Python :class:`typing.Protocol` s are used for structural typing: essentially, they are
used to describe an expected interface in a way that is helpful for static type checkers
to make sure concrete implementations provide everything that is needed for a workflow
to function. :class:`typing.Protocol` s are not actually enforced at runtime, and
inheritance is not required for them to function: as long as the implementation
provides the expected attributes and methods, they will be compatible with the protocol.

The active learning framework is built around several key protocol abstractions
that work together to orchestrate the active learning workflow:

**Core Infrastructure Protocols:**
 - `AbstractQueue[T]` - Generic queue protocol for passing data between components
 - `DataPool[T]` - Protocol for data reservoirs that support appending and sampling
 - `ActiveLearningProtocol` - Base protocol providing common interface for all AL strategies

**Strategy Protocols (inherit from ActiveLearningProtocol):**
 - `QueryStrategy` - Defines how to select data points for labeling
 - `LabelStrategy` - Defines processes for adding ground truth labels to unlabeled data
 - `MetrologyStrategy` - Defines procedures that assess model improvements beyond validation metrics

**Model Interface Protocols:**
 - `TrainingProtocol` - Interface for training step functions
 - `ValidationProtocol` - Interface for validation step functions
 - `InferenceProtocol` - Interface for inference step functions
 - `TrainingLoop` - Interface for complete training loop implementations
 - `LearnerProtocol` - Comprehensive interface for learner modules (combines training/validation/inference)

**Orchestration Protocol:**
 - `DriverProtocol` - Main orchestrator that coordinates all components in the active learning loop

Active Learning Workflow
------------------------

The typical active learning workflow orchestrated by `DriverProtocol` follows this sequence:

1. **Training Phase**: Use `LearnerProtocol` or `TrainingLoop` to train the model on `training_pool`
2. **Metrology Phase** (optional): Apply `MetrologyStrategy` instances to assess model performance
3. **Query Phase**: Apply `QueryStrategy` instances to select samples from `unlabeled_pool` → `query_queue`
4. **Labeling Phase** (optional): Apply `LabelStrategy` instances to label queued samples → `label_queue`
5. **Data Integration**: Move labeled data from `label_queue` to `training_pool`

Type Parameters
---------------
- `T`: Data structure containing both inputs and ground truth labels
- `S`: Data structure containing only inputs (no ground truth labels)

    Defines a generic queue protocol for data that is passed between active
    learning components.

    This can be a simple local `queue.Queue`, or a more sophisticated
    distributed queue system.

    The primary use case for this is to allow a query strategy to
    enqueue some data structure for the labeling strategy to consume,
    and once the labeling is done, enqueue to a data serialization
    workflow. While there is no explcit restriction on the **type**
    of queue that is implemented, a reasonable assumption to make
    would be a FIFO queue, unless otherwise specified by the concrete
    implementation.

    Optional Serialization Methods
    -------------------------------
    Implementations may optionally provide `to_list()` and `from_list()`
    methods for checkpoint serialization. If not provided, the queue
    will be serialized using `torch.save()` as a fallback.

    Type Parameters
    ---------------
    T

        (Optional) Validation is intended to be performed either at the end of a training

        The key difference between specifying ``train_step_fn`` and :class:`LearnerProtocol`
        is that the former excludes the backward pass and optimizer step logic,
        whereas the latter encapsulates them.

        The ``device`` and ``dtype`` parameters are used to specify the device and

            the :class:`LearnerProtocol`, then this function will take precedence over
            the :meth:`LearnerProtocol.validation_step` method.
        max_epochs: int or None
            The maximum number of epochs to train for. Mututally exclusive

        max_val_steps: int or None
            The maximum number of validation steps to perform per training

        lr_scheduler: `_LRScheduler` or None
            The learning rate scheduler to use for training. If provided,

class DriverProtocol:
    """
    This protocol specifies the expected interface for an active learning
    driver: for a concrete implementation, refer to the :mod:`~physicsnemo.active_learning.driver`
    module instead. The specification is provided mostly as a reference, and for
    ease of type hinting to prevent circular imports.

    Attributes
    ----------
    learner: :class:`LearnerProtocol`
        The learner module that will be used as the surrogate within
        the active learning loop.
    query_strategies: list
        The query strategies that will be used for selecting data points to label.
        A list of :class:`QueryStrategy` instances can be included, and will sequentially be used to
        populate the ``query_queue`` that passes samples over to labeling.
    query_queue: :class:`AbstractQueue`
        The queue containing data samples to be labeled. :class:`QueryStrategy` instances
        should enqueue samples to this queue.
    label_strategy: :class:`LabelStrategy` or None
        The label strategy that will be used for labeling data points. In contrast
        to the other strategies, only a single label strategy is supported.
        This strategy will consume the ``query_queue`` and enqueue labeled data to
        the ``label_queue``.
    label_queue: :class:`AbstractQueue` or None
        The queue containing freshly labeled data. :class:`LabelStrategy` instances
        should enqueue labeled data to this queue, and the driver will subsequently
        serialize data contained within this queue to a persistent format.
    metrology_strategies: list or None
        The metrology strategies that will be used for assessing the performance
        of the surrogate. A list of :class:`MetrologyStrategy` instances can be included, and will sequentially
        be used to populate the ``metrology_queue`` that passes data over to the
        learner.
    training_pool: :class:`DataPool`
        The pool of data to be used for training. This data will be used to train
        the underlying model, and is assumed to be mutable in that additional data
        can be added to the pool over the course of active learning.
    validation_pool: :class:`DataPool` or None
        The pool of data to be used for validation. This data will be used for both
        conventional validation, as well as for metrology. This dataset is considered
        to be immutable, and should not be modified over the course of active learning.
        This dataset is considered optional, as both validation and metrology are.
    unlabeled_pool: :class:`DataPool` or None
        An optional pool of data to be used for querying and labeling. If supplied,
        this dataset can be depleted by a query strategy to select data points for labeling.
        In principle, this could also represent a generative model, i.e. not just a static
        dataset, but at a high level represents a distribution of data.
