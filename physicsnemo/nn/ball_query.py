        Performs ball query operation to find neighboring points and their features.

        This method uses the Warp-accelerated ball query implementation to find points

        - Forward mapping: Find points from x that are near p_grid points (reverse_mapping=False)

            reverse_mapping: Boolean flag to control the direction of the mapping:
